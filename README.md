## How to use
* Prepare your bag files and extract the data
    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/tonycar12002/duckiepond-imitaion-learning.git
    $ cd ~/duckiepond-imitaion-learning/extract_data
    $ mkdir -p data/bag_files
    (Put your bag files here and rename "NUMBER_VEHNAME.bag". ex:1_MONICA.bag )
    $ cd ~/duckiepond-imitaion-learning/extract_data
    $ python src/extract_data.py
    ```
* Training
    ```
    $ cp -r duckiepond-imitaion-learning/extract_data/data duckiepond-imitaion-learning/learning
    $ cd ~/duckiepond-imitaion-learning/learning
    $ python src/cnn_training_tensorflow.py
    ```

## Description

In this baseline template, driving behavior is learned using imitation learning from `rosbag` logs.

Follow the makefile in the individual folders of this repository. 

1. Download and extract data using the Makefile in the `extract_data` folder. 
2. Learn a model using the Makefile and scripts in the `learning` folder.
3. Submit the learned model by running `make submit` in the `submission` folder.
